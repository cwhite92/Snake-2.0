Snake 2.0
=========

Snake 2.0 is the result of a project I had to complete for one of my programming modules. The specification was to write a game (or anything with a feedback loop) in ActionScript using OO principles. I managed to get the game done in a couple of nights, and then implemented teleportation from the feedback that a coursemate gave me.
